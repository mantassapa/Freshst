            <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                    the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap
                    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                    the
                    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing
                    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                </strong></p>
            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                when
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                of
                letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                evolved
                over the years, sometimes by, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
